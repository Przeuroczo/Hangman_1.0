# Hangman_1.0
If you are reading this Readme that means I have survived. You may ask why I would say "survived"? It's because I know very little about coding, but using C# documentation, I was able to develop a working Hangman game.  It was quite an adventure.

I know this is not the best code or even the easy way to implement it. I know it because I live with a developer in one house, and he told me so when I asked for some feedback. Nevertheless, I'm happy about the results, because with my very little knowledge, only in few days, I was able to complete it. What is more important is that I did it by myself, thanks to my self-learning skills. I could have asked him to help me, to tell me what is the best way to code this game, but I felt it wouldn't be a fair way to approach this recruitment task and I believe this "better way" could be too complicated for my level. Maybe my code is too long and "a little" clumsy, but I understand it, and I can tell what each part of it does.

But why I did it? I have a little coding background from University, but when I am going to tell this story I would have to start with "A long, long time ago...". Maybe you know I am a designer and you may wonder if I don't like it. I do like design, but I don't like how a designer's work looks in reality. But it is better to not talk about it as I would complain a lot. 

I always considered coding as an interesting area. This is a reason why I've decided to try. Now, after this "hangman assignment", I know I like it as much as I like a design. I could get into it.
